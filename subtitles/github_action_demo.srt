Hello everyone! Welcome to our physics lecture today.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Today we'll be discussing quantum mechanics and wave-particle duality.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,000
The photoelectric effect demonstrates that light behaves as both waves and particles.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Einstein's equation E=mc² shows the relationship between energy and mass.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
In quantum field theory, particles are excitations of underlying fields.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,500
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle limits our knowledge of position and momentum.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Schrödinger's equation describes how quantum states evolve over time.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Thank you for attending today's lecture on quantum physics fundamentals.
