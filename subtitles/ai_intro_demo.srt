Welcome to Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Today we'll explore the fundamentals of machine learning.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There are three main types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for prediction tasks.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Neural networks are inspired by the human brain's structure and function.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Deep learning uses multiple layers to extract features from raw data.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Natural language processing allows machines to understand human language.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Computer vision enables AI systems to interpret and analyze visual information.
