Welcome to this physics lecture on quantum mechanics.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Today we will discuss the Schrödinger equation and its applications.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,000
The wave function describes the quantum state of a system.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Let's consider a particle in a one-dimensional potential well.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
The boundary conditions require the wave function to vanish at the walls.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,500
This leads to quantized energy levels, as we will see.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,000
The energy eigenvalues are given by En = n²π²ħ²/(2mL²).

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Where n is the quantum number, m is the particle mass, and L is the well width.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,000
This is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics.
